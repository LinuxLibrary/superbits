# Catch Point

- Catch Point is a website and web-application performance monitoring tool
- With Catch Point we can measure, monitor and analyze the performance of website, web-based application or servers
- We can configure and perform tests as we desire. Below are some types of tests.
	- Web Test Type
	- Transaction Test Type
	- HTML Test Type
	- API Test Type
	- WebSocket Test Type
	- Streaming Test Type
	- DNS Test Type
	- FTP Test Type
	- TCP Test Type
	- SMTP Test Type
	- Ping Test Type
	- Traceroute Test Type
	- SSH Test Type

* ***Web Test Type***
```
The Catchpoint Web test offers crucial insight to the performance of your webpage. The test examines a single
webpage where you are able to customize how that webpage is investigated by choosing the type of monitor, in-
-cluding additional elements to the HTTP request header, and defining advanced settings. Additionally, you can
override the default values set up at the Product and Folder level for targeting, scheduling, authentication, 
HTTP requests, Insight collection and alerts.
```

* ***Transaction Test Type***
```
Catchpoint allows you to use the Selenium language to record transactions then copy and paste the result into
a Test Monitor to run on a periodic basis. Selenium is primarily for automating web applications and testing.
Catchpoint lets you use the power of Selenium to create customized Test Monitors with minimal effort.
```

* ***HTML Code Test Type***
```
An HTML Code test examines HTML code without first requesting it from the server. This allows you to input your
HTML directly in Catchpoint so that you can test how it performs in a test environment. Creating a test involv-
-es defining what you want Catchpoint to test and how you want the test to behave. Additionally, you can overr-
-ide the default values set up at the Product and Folder level for targeting, scheduling, Insight collection 
and alerts.
```

* ***API Test Type***
```
Both API monitoring tests and Web Transaction tests use the Selenium scripting language and multi-step tests,
as well as custom Catchpoint actions, assertions, and macros. API test transactions, however, access URLs then
parse their XML or JSON responses before completing the next step in the test. There is no HTML to render, no
Javascript to execute, and no CSS.
```

* ***WebSocket Test Type***
```
Often used in chats, financial tickers, and gaming applications, WebSockets allow for simultaneous real-time
communication between client and server through a single persistent connection. With the WebSocket Test you
can monitor WebSockets by establishing a connection, sending data, asserting the server response, and creat-
-ing custom metrics based on the response.
